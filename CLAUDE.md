## Repository Context

This is the Barbie's Bail Bonds website project. The main goal is to create a form that connects to Google Sheets for managing bail bond inquiries.

## Link Behavior Rules

**IMPORTANT**: Follow these link behavior rules for all pages:

- **Internal navigation** (within Barbie's Bail Bonds site): Links should open in the same tab (no `target="_blank"`)
  - Examples: Navigation between pages, application links to Google Sites forms
- **External links** (to other websites): Links should open in new tab (`target="_blank"`)
  - Examples: PBSO Inmate Locator, YouTube videos, Google Maps, external resources

## Phone Number Formatting Rules

**IMPORTANT**: Ensure phone numbers never break across lines:

- **Always** add `white-space: nowrap;` CSS property to phone numbers
- This prevents phone numbers from wrapping and breaking across multiple lines
- Apply to all instances of the phone number 561-247-0018
- Example: `<strong style="color: var(--brand); white-space: nowrap;">561-247-0018</strong>`

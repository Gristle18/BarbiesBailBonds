SELF-LEARNING VECTOR-BASED DOCUMENT EXTRACTION SYSTEM
================================================================

PROJECT OVERVIEW:
Implement an intelligent document processing system that learns to extract and organize 
OCR'd text into Google Sheets using vector embeddings and self-improving AI algorithms.

CORE CONCEPT:
- Each spreadsheet column has a "learned vector" representing its data type
- Extracted document chunks get their own vectors
- Vector similarity determines where data goes (close vectors = green, far vectors = red)
- System improves over time by learning from successful human-verified extractions

================================================================

SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE:

1. VECTOR COLUMN SYSTEM
   - Each Google Sheets column gets a semantic vector
   - Initially based on column headers ("Name", "DOB", "Address")
   - Progressively enhanced by successful data extractions
   - Stores historical "good matches" to refine column vectors

2. DOCUMENT PROCESSING PIPELINE
   Document → OCR → Text Chunking → Vector Generation → Similarity Matching → Column Assignment → Color Coding

3. SELF-LEARNING MECHANISM
   - When humans confirm/correct extractions, store those vectors
   - Recalculate column vectors from all successful matches
   - Adapt to specific document types and data patterns
   - No configuration required - learns YOUR data patterns

4. VISUAL CONFIDENCE SYSTEM
   - Cell colors based on vector similarity scores
   - Green (0.85-1.0): High confidence, likely correct
   - Yellow (0.65-0.84): Medium confidence, quick review
   - Red (0.0-0.64): Low confidence, manual review required

================================================================

DATA STRUCTURE:

COLUMN VECTOR STORAGE:
{
  "columnId": "A",
  "name": "Applicant Name",
  "masterVector": [0.23, 0.45, 0.67, ...],  // Average of all successful matches
  "samples": [
    {
      "vector": [0.21, 0.44, 0.69, ...],
      "value": "John Smith",
      "context": "Name: John Smith",
      "timestamp": "2025-01-15",
      "confidence": 0.94
    }
  ],
  "thresholds": {
    "green": 0.85,
    "yellow": 0.65
  }
}

EXTRACTION RESULT:
{
  "text": "John Smith",
  "vector": [0.22, 0.46, 0.68, ...],
  "context": "Applicant Name: John Smith",
  "bestMatch": {
    "columnId": "A",
    "similarity": 0.94,
    "confidence": "high"
  },
  "alternativeMatches": [
    {"columnId": "F", "similarity": 0.23},
    {"columnId": "B", "similarity": 0.15}
  ]
}

================================================================

API INTEGRATION:

GEMINI API USAGE:
1. Text Extraction from Images/PDFs
   - Use Gemini 2.0 Flash for OCR ($0.20 per 1M input tokens)
   - Extract all text with context preservation

2. Vector Embeddings
   - Use Gemini Embedding API ($0.15 per 1M tokens, $0.075 batch)
   - Generate embeddings for both text chunks and column definitions

3. Cost Optimization:
   - Use batch processing (50% discount)
   - Cache column vectors (one-time generation)
   - Process only necessary document sections

GOOGLE SHEETS INTEGRATION:
- Apps Script for cell value and color updates
- Real-time confidence visualization
- Hover notes with detailed extraction info
- Audit trail of changes and corrections

================================================================

CONFIDENCE SYSTEM:

COLOR GRADIENT MAPPING:
- 95-100%: Deep Green (#0F9D58) - Trust completely
- 85-94%:  Light Green (#81C784) - Very likely correct
- 75-84%:  Yellow-Green (#C5E1A5) - Probably correct
- 65-74%:  Yellow (#FFD54F) - Needs verification
- 55-64%:  Orange (#FFB74D) - Likely incorrect
- 45-54%:  Light Red (#FF8A65) - Probably wrong
- 0-44%:   Deep Red (#F44336) - Very uncertain

FIELD-SPECIFIC THRESHOLDS:
- SSN: Requires 95%+ confidence (critical field)
- DOB: Requires 90%+ confidence (important for verification)
- Name: Requires 85%+ confidence (some variation acceptable)
- Address: Requires 75%+ confidence (often partially extracted)
- Phone: Requires 70%+ confidence (format variations common)

================================================================

LEARNING ALGORITHM:

INITIAL COLUMN VECTORS:
1. Generate embeddings from column headers
2. Enhance with contextual keywords
   Example: "DOB" → "Date of Birth, Birthday, Born, Birth Date, DOB"
3. Create baseline confidence thresholds

PROGRESSIVE LEARNING:
1. User confirms extracted data is correctly placed
2. Store the extraction's vector in column's sample database
3. Recalculate column's master vector as average of all samples
4. Adjust confidence thresholds based on historical accuracy
5. System becomes more accurate with each correction

CROSS-COLUMN INTELLIGENCE:
- Detect when similar data could fit multiple columns
- Use historical patterns to make best placement decision
- Flag ambiguous placements with intermediate colors
- Learn relationships between fields (e.g., names rarely contain numbers)

================================================================

DOCUMENT TYPE HANDLING:

GOVERNMENT ID (Driver's License, State ID, Passport):
- Target Fields: Name, DOB, ID Number, Address, Issue/Expiration Dates
- Expected Accuracy: 85-90%
- Special Handling: Structured layout, consistent formatting

PROOF OF ADDRESS (Utility Bills, Bank Statements, Lease):
- Target Fields: Account Holder Name, Service Address, Document Date
- Expected Accuracy: 75-85%
- Special Handling: Variable formats, multiple addresses possible

PROOF OF EMPLOYMENT (Paystubs, Employment Letters, W2/1099):

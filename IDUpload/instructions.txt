ID & Document Upload â€“ Wiring Instructions
=========================================

This page includes a client-side form and a JavaScript submit stub.
To actually receive files, connect the form to a backend endpoint.

Option A: Google Apps Script (Drive upload)
-------------------------------------------
1) Create a new Google Apps Script project and add a script that:
   - Accepts a `multipart/form-data` POST request
   - Saves uploaded files to a Drive folder
   - Persists form fields (JSON) into a Google Sheet
2) Deploy as Web App (Anyone with the link can access).
3) Copy the Web App URL and set it as `UPLOAD_ENDPOINT` in `scripts/upload.js`.

Option B: File form to Google Forms
-----------------------------------
If you prefer not to host a custom script, you can point users to a Google Form
with File Upload fields enabled (requires Google Workspace). In that case, link
the form in the page and remove the custom submit stub.

Client-side Constraints & Tips
------------------------------
- Allowed types: images (jpg, png, heic, webp), and PDF
- Suggested limit: <= 10MB per file
- Multiple additional documents are supported
- On success, show a confirmation message; on failure, show a fallback

Fallback Instructions (no backend yet)
-------------------------------------
- If `UPLOAD_ENDPOINT` is not configured, the form will not POST files.
- The page provides a fallback: call or text photos to 561-247-0018.

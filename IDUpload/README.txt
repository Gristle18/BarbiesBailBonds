ID & Document Upload Page
=========================

Purpose:
- Secure page for clients to upload a government ID (front/back) and any supporting documents to speed up the bond process.

Structure:
- `index.html`: Page markup and styles.
- `scripts/upload.js`: Client-side logic (drag & drop, validation, submit stub).
- `assets/`: Placeholder for images or other media.
- `instructions.txt`: How to wire the form to a backend (Google Apps Script or similar).

Notes:
- Phone number `561-247-0018` is rendered with `white-space: nowrap` to avoid line breaks (repo standard).
- External links (none by default) must use `target="_blank"`. Internal links should open in the same tab.

FAQ Page
========

Purpose:
- Provide clear answers to common questions about bonds, premiums, responsibilities, warrants, release times, and special cases.

Structure:
- `index.html`: Page markup, styles, and layout for FAQ content
- `scripts/faq.js`: Simple accordion behavior for expanding/collapsing answers
- `assets/`: Placeholder for any future images or media
- `instructions.txt`: Notes on editing, adding questions, and repo-wide standards

Notes:
- Internal links open in the same tab; external links open in a new tab.
- Use `white-space: nowrap` on our phone number `561-247-0018` to prevent line breaks.
- Keep content consistent with tone and style used on other pages in the repo.
